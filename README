A simple tool to create a configuration file for GNOME/Unity Wallpaper manager,
based on paths to wallpaper files. It outputs to stdout an XML file to present
a wallpapers slideshow in the desktop background. The images files are obtained
from the parameters given by the user in the command line. The XML outputed to
stdout can be redirected to a XML file, which can be loaded from the disk using
the GNOME wallpaper tool.


Basic usage:
	bggen.py -p /complete/path/to/wallpapers/folder -t 10



Depends on:
	python python-argparse
